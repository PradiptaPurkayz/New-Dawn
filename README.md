# New-Dawn
For my new 'deep' learnings :-)

Pradipta here !!
I believe in the mantra "Learn, Share and Grow". 
Have a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Sikkim Manipal University of Health, Medical and Technological Sciences. 
With 6 years of experience in the IT industry, I am very much excited about Revolution 4.0, which will have a paradigm shift on society as a whole and on an individual in particular. 
I have worked in several Agile methodologies, including SAFe 3.0 and also have extensive knowledge in testing encompassing Functional, E2E, Integration, Exploratory and Database testings. 
I was performing the role of a Business Analyst for three and a half years alongside my testing activities. Have knowledge about test management and artifacts management using HP ALM and JIRA. Have worked in a nascent reporting project where we built dashboards from scratch using Microsoft Power BI and business intelligence solutions. 
In my off time, I love to read books, watch movies and catch up with friends and near ones.
